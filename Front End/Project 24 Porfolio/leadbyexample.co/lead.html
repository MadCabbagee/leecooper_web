          <h2>I-Phone 15/15 Pro Opinion</h1>
          <p>
            Th best way to stack on track of the best tech is to make sure that
            you are staying consistent with yourk work. Once you are able to do
            this, a whole new world will open up to you. It is often stated that
            when buying a new phone that the purchase has to do with something
            that has been upgraded for the year. The action button was a major
            change in how the user interacts with the new I phone.

          <h2>Apple Vision Pro Personal Review</h2>
          <p>
            There are many people who wil buy the Apple Vision Pro do to its
            appearence close to ski goggles and in its own world. I believe that
            if you put yourself within he virtual reality.The price is sort of
            outstanding considering what the minimum wage in some countries are
            depending on whether it is being sold to them.You want to make sure
            that as you looking through the goggles that you can look to long in
            them other wise it might damage you eyes and give you a headache. It
            seems contreversial that you haave to enter that kindf door in the
            first place.People dont often look at the reasons behind the product
            unless it is placed in front of them.There are different things that
            you may be able to do in the long run that will control the user. We
            have to make sure that reguation, if gone bad would show the world.
            I as a human being believe that you haave to keep pushing the
            boundaries of eachother. You have to keep pressing the same buttons
            on me. Why would we allow our selves as a civilization to keep
            showing techingnology in the first place make the world what it is
            now up to a certain point to keep.The vision pro is going to get to the point where be allows you to have enough technology for the appple glasses which is sort of along the lines
            of the product that they are looking to have. The target audience
            for the product is mostly people who have at least 200,000$ per
            year. The 3,400 product is for people who want to have the latest
            and greatest tech possible.
